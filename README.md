# Study of microsatellite sequences in the Red fox population

## Brief introduction to study
We obtained data for two populations of red fox. We studied the three sequences REN25E18, REN397J23 and REN75M10. Our task was to analyse the two populations and infer from the calculations whether the populations are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to the given sequences.


## Conclusion of results
The calculations performed on genotype frequencies and F- statistics aim to investigate among the common fox population the phenomenon of genetic balance and genetic variation among individuals.

The sequence REN25E18 shows low genetic variability and high homozygosity. This sequence is inconsistent with Hardy-Weinberg's law. This may indicate that the population has been segregated in some way, or that the homozygotes reveal traits that are more favourable in the living environment of the individuals studied.

Among the REN307J23 sequences, a large genetic variation between subpopulations can be seen, and there are differences in their structure, with population II showing a significant advantage in the number of genotypes over population I. While the first population is skewed towards heterozygosity, the second population also leans towards homozygosity - so the sequence is close to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, but does not reach it.

The REN75M10 sequence tends most strongly towards Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium. Also, the observed and expected value of heterozygosity across the population is most similar.

It should be remembered that the study was conducted on small populations, so the results may be unreliable and not coincide with the actual situation found in the red fox population.
